                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs  are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid 
                        regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. Although covered in bristly hairs, a 
                        warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a 
                        crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious.</p>  
                    <p>The male warthogs also have very prominent tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 
                        inches (25 to 64 centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs are largely herbivorous, but, like most suids, opportunistically eat 
                        invertebrates or small animals, even scavenging on carrion</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen E23, right next to the lost forest.</p>
