                    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera 
                        native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, 
                        a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes.</p>
                    <p> The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes 
                        by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, 
                        defending these from individuals of the same sex.</p>

                        and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.</p>
