                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Pantheraand. It has a muscular, 
                        broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at 
                        the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than 
                        females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called 
                        prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>
                    <p>Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and 
                        large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
                    <p>Lions are carnivores and inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands.</p>

                    <p>You will find the Lions at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
